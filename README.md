# Project Title

Simple Javascript Weather Application

## Description

This application is used to help people discover basic weather information from their own city or any other from around the world. Degrees celcius, humidity percentage, and wind speed (kilometres per hour) is displayed. It uses an API from Open Weather Map to collect and display this weather information. The application uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Features

- The application contains a search bar for users to input their desired city.
- Users are able to search the weather by clicking the search icon located on the right side of the input field.
- The application displays degrees celcius, humidity, and wind speed in kilometres per hour.
- A weather image relevant to the city's current weather is displayed, giving users an idea of the weather at a glance.
- When users type an incorrect city name, "Invalid City Name" is displayed.

## Usage

- To search for a city, click on the search bar which contains the text "enter city name". Then, click on the search icon located to the right of the search bar.
- To search for another city, simply replace the search bar with another city name and click on the search icon.

## Possible Improvements

- The application could be more user friendly if there was a keydown event for the return (Enter) button instead of a click event. 
- The application could also be improved by displaying fahrenheit and miles per hour for American users.
